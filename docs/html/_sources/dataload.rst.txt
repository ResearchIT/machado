Data loading
============

`Chado <http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_-_Getting_Started>`_ "is capable of representing many of the general classes of data frequently encountered in modern biology such as sequence, sequence comparisons, phenotypes, genotypes, ontologies, publications, and phylogeny".

The data files must be loaded in a particular order, taking into account their `inter dependencies <http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_Manual#Module_Dependencies>`_.
