[Term]
id: SO:0000147
name: exon
def: "A region of the transcript sequence within a gene which is not removed from the primary RNA transcript by RNA splicing." [SO:ke]
comment: This term is mapped to MGED. Do not obsolete without consulting MGED ontology.

id: SO:0000234
name: mRNA
def: "Messenger RNA is the intermediate molecule between DNA and protein. It includes UTR and coding sequences. It does not contain introns." [SO:ma]
comment: An mRNA does not contain introns as it is a processed_transcript. The equivalent kind of primary_transcript is protein_coding_primary_transcript (SO:0000120) which may contain introns. This term is mapped to MGED. Do not obsolete without consulting MGED ontology.
